Good morning!

Here's today's problem:

This problem was asked by Affirm.

Assume we have a classifier that produces a score between 0 and 1 for the probability of a particular loan application behind a fraud. Say that for each application’s score, we take the square root of that score. How would the ROC curve change? If it doesn’t change, what kinds of functions would change the curve?
