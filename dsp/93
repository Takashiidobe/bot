Good morning!

Here's today's problem:

This problem was asked by Stripe.

Say we are using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for anomaly detection on fraudulent transactions to classify incoming transactions into K classes. Describe the model setup formulaically and how to evaluate the posterior probabilities and log likelihood. How can we determine if a new transaction should be deemed fraudulent?
