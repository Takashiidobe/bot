Good morning!

Here's today's problem:

This problem was asked by Facebook.

You have the entire social graph of Facebook users, with nodes representing users and edges representing friendships between users. Given the edges of the graph and the number of nodes, write a function to return the smallest number of friendships in-between two users.

For example, if the graph consists of 5 users A, B, C, D, E, and the friendship edges are: (A, B), (A, C), (B, D), (D, E) then the function should return 2 for the input A and E.
