Good morning!

Here's today's problem:

This problem was asked by Lyft.

Say we are given a list of several categories (for example, the strings: A, B, C, and D) and want to sample from a list of such categories according to a particular weighting scheme. Such an example would be: for 100 items total, we want to see A 20% of the time, B 15% of the time, C 35% of the time, and D 30% of the time. How do we simulate this? What if we care about an arbitrary number of categories and about memory usage?
